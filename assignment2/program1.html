which accommodate the unique characteristics of each food. Nutrient-Rich Cooking not only helps preserve nutrients but brings out the great flavor of food.

<span class="bold">Directions:</span>
<ol>
<li>Heat oven to 425 degrees F. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss the sweet potatoes and red onion with 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes. Scatter the mushrooms on the pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Continue roasting until the vegetables are golden brown and tender, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the steak with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook to desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to plates and cover with foil.</li>
<li>Add the wine to the pan and cook, scraping up any brown bits, for 30 seconds. Add the cream and mustard and simmer until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Season witha pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then stir in the tarragon. Spoon over the steaks and serve with the vegetables.</li>
